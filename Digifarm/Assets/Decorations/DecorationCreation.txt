Every Decoration has the following
decName - name of the decoration
decDescription - not yet implemented, but essentiall flavor text
decSprite - what the decoration looks like on the farm and in menus
baseSprite - I think you don't have to worry about this one. But incase it appears as null in the inspector there's a sprite called decSpot
	in the assets folder. Put that there.
animations - currenlty unused. I'll update this section when nessecary.
statBoosts - array of stats. Never fill out 0,1, or 3. The rest are fine, these numbers are given to the monster upon level up.

TO CREATE A DECORATION

Right click in the file explorere, click baseDecoration
Alternatively copy and paste a furniture piece you'd like to work off of

Currently integration of furniture is poor, but if you'd like to make sure it works go to the FarmManager object in the Farm scene and increase the length
	the ownedDec list and drag and drop the new decoration in it.
